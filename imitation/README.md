### Generative Adverserial Imitation Learning
* This paper introduces an adverserial learning framework for imitation learning, wherein the policy is the generator(initialized randomly) and a discriminator is used to optimize the policy to match the expert policy. Specifically, the discriminator outputs the probability of a state having originated from a trace from the imitator policy.
* Results: [TODO]

### Third Person Imitation Learning
